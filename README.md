An Asynchronous Riak client for Java
====================================

This library offers a high-level API to interact with
[Riak](http://basho.com/riak/) in an asynchronous fashion.

It is based on the excellent [Asynchronous HTTP and WebSocket Client library
for Java](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client).
